## Product Requirements Document: Simple To-Do Application with Enhanced Visual Experience

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** [Your Name/Company]

---

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple To-Do application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application will feature a robust authentication system, ensuring data privacy and separation for each user. While providing standard To-Do functionalities, a key differentiator will be its unique user experience, achieved through an enhanced visual design incorporating engaging animations and transitions. The application will leverage MongoDB Atlas for reliable data storage and a modern serverless platform for deployment.

### 2. Goals & Objectives

The primary goals and objectives for this project are:

*   **Core Functionality:** Develop a fully functional To-Do application enabling users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their tasks.
*   **User Management:** Implement a secure and reliable authentication system for user registration, login, and session management.
*   **Data Isolation:** Ensure strict separation of user data, meaning each user's To-Do items are private and inaccessible to others.
*   **Data Persistence:** Utilize MongoDB Atlas as the primary, cloud-based source of truth for all application data.
*   **Deployment:** Deploy the application on a modern serverless platform (e.g., Vercel) for scalability, ease of maintenance, and cost-effectiveness.
*   **Differentiation:** Offer a unique user experience characterized by an enhanced visual design, incorporating engaging animations and transitions to make task management more enjoyable and intuitive.

### 3. User Stories

The following user stories describe the application's functionality from the perspective of an end-user:

*   **Authentication & Account Management:**
    *   As a new user, I want to register for an account using my email and password so I can start using the To-Do app.
    *   As a registered user, I want to log in to my account so I can access my personalized To-Do list.
    *   As a user, I want my login session to be secure so my data remains private.
*   **To-Do Item Management:**
    *   As a user, I want to create a new To-Do item with a title and optional description so I can keep track of my tasks.
    *   As a user, I want to view all my To-Do items in a clear list format so I can see what I need to do.
    *   As a user, I want to mark a To-Do item as complete so I can track my progress and feel a sense of accomplishment.
    *   As a user, I want to edit an existing To-Do item (e.g., title, description, status) so I can update its details as needed.
    *   As a user, I want to delete a To-Do item so I can remove completed or irrelevant tasks from my list.
    *   As a user, I want to be confident that my To-Do items are only visible to me and not to other users.
*   **User Experience:**
    *   As a user, I want the application to be visually appealing and engaging, with smooth animations and transitions, so that managing my tasks is a pleasant experience.
    *   As a user, I want the interface to be intuitive and easy to navigate so I can quickly perform actions without confusion.

### 4. Features

#### 4.1. Authentication System

*   **User Registration:** Allow new users to create an account using a unique email address and a secure password.
*   **User Login:** Enable registered users to log in with their credentials.
*   **Secure Session Management:** Implement token-based (e.g., JWT) or session-based authentication to maintain user sessions securely.
*   **Password Hashing:** Store user passwords securely using industry-standard hashing algorithms.

#### 4.2. To-Do Management

*   **Create To-Do Item:**
    *   Input fields for To-Do title (mandatory).
    *   Optional input field for To-Do description.
    *   Default status: "Pending".
*   **View To-Do Items:**
    *   Display a list of all To-Do items belonging to the logged-in user.
    *   Clearly indicate the status of each item (e.g., Pending, Completed).
*   **Edit To-Do Item:**
    *   Allow users to modify the title, description, and status of an existing To-Do item.
*   **Mark as Complete/Incomplete:**
    *   Provide a simple mechanism (e.g., checkbox, button) to toggle the completion status of a To-Do item.
*   **Delete To-Do Item:**
    *   Allow users to permanently remove a To-Do item from their list.
*   **Data Isolation:** Ensure that database queries are scoped to the authenticated user, preventing cross-user data access.

#### 4.3. User Experience & Interface

*   **Intuitive Design:** A clean, minimalist, and user-friendly interface.
*   **Enhanced Visual Design:** A unique user experience with an enhanced visual design, incorporating engaging animations and transitions for actions like adding a new task, marking a task complete, or navigating between views.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application should be fully responsive and accessible across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

#### 4.4. Data Storage

*   **MongoDB Atlas:** Utilize MongoDB Atlas as the cloud-hosted NoSQL database for storing all user and To-Do data.
*   **Schema Design:** Design a flexible schema to store user information and To-Do items, ensuring efficient querying and data integrity.

#### 4.5. Deployment

*   **Serverless Platform:** Deploy the application on a modern serverless platform (e.g., Vercel for frontend/API routes) to ensure high availability, automatic scaling, and simplified operations.

### 5. Technical Architecture (High-Level)

*   **Frontend:** A modern JavaScript framework/library (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
*   **Backend:** A Node.js-based server (e.g., Express.js) to handle API requests, authentication, and database interactions.
*   **Database:** MongoDB Atlas for persistent data storage.
*   **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or secure session cookies for user authentication and authorization.
*   **Deployment:** Frontend and Backend APIs deployed on a serverless platform (e.g., Vercel).

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**
    *   Fast loading times for all pages and components.
    *   Responsive interactions with minimal latency for CRUD operations.
    *   Efficient database queries to ensure quick data retrieval.
*   **Security:**
    *   Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection - relevant for NoSQL too).
    *   Secure handling of sensitive user data.
    *   HTTPS enforcement for all communications.
*   **Scalability:**
    *   The architecture should be designed to handle a growing number of users and To-Do items without significant performance degradation, leveraging MongoDB Atlas and serverless deployment benefits.
*   **Usability:**
    *   The application must be intuitive and easy for users to learn and operate.
    *   Clear feedback mechanisms for user actions (e.g., success messages, error notifications).
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   The codebase should be clean, well-structured, and documented to facilitate future enhancements and bug fixes.
    *   Adherence to coding standards and best practices.

### 7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for V1)

The following features are considered out of scope for the initial version but may be considered for future iterations:

*   **Categories/Tags:** Ability to categorize or tag To-Do items for better organization.
*   **Due Dates & Reminders:** Functionality to set due dates and receive notifications/reminders for tasks.
*   **Collaboration:** Sharing To-Do lists with other users.
*   **Advanced Filtering/Sorting:** Options to filter tasks by status, due date, or sort them alphabetically.
*   **Search Functionality:** Ability to search for specific To-Do items.
*   **User Profile Management:** Options for users to update their profile information or change passwords.
